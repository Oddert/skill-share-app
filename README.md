# Skill Sharing App

A very early CRUD project built for a FreeCodeCamp challenge.

Extending on the brief to make a book sharing app, this project imagined a university environment that could benefit from a platform for students to share physical objects but also trade skills and tutoring.

I may potentially remake this app at some point but leave this version hosted for the sake of preserving early work.
